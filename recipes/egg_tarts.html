    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 dash vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>9 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 dash vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar and flour. Mix 
            in butter with a fork until it is in small crumbs. Stir in the egg and 
            vanilla until the mixture forms a dough. The texture should be slightly 
            moist. Add more butter if it is too dry, or more flour, if the dough seems 
            greasy. Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls, and press the balls into tart
             molds so that it covers the bottom, and goes up higher than the sides. 
             Use 2 fingers to shape the edge into an A shape.

            Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine the white sugar
             and water in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar
              is dissolved, remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Strain the 
              eggs through a sieve, and whisk into the sugar mixture. Stir in the evaporated
               milk and vanilla. Strain the filling through a sieve, and fill the tart shells.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown, and the 
            filling is puffed up a little bit.
