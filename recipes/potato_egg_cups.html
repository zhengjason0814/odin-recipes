    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> These leftover mashed potato egg cups are a great way to use up mashed potatoes, and are quick and easy to 
        assemble for breakfast or brunch. We like our eggs cooked until you can still dip a piece of toast into the 
        yolk, but cook to your preference.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces cooked mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons milk</li>
        <li>4 thin pats unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Sliced Green onions or chives, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spray 4 (6 ounce) ramekins with cooking spray. Place 4 ounces mashed potatoes into each ramekin. Using the back of a spoon, mold into nests, and brush with 1 lightly beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Break 1 of the 4 remaining eggs into each ramekin. Drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon milk, top with 1 pat of butter, and 1 tablespoon Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook until yolk is starting to set and cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes (cooking time will depend on how you want your eggs cooked). Remove from the oven, and let stand until residual heat finishes cooking the egg whites, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper, garnish with green onions or chives, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
